# CollatzGraph

Today on YouTube I learned of the Collatz Conjecture and wanted to graph the flow of the first n integers following the rules outlined in the Collatz Conjecture. 

The rules are as follows:

- If the number is even, half it.
- If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

The program in its current state is a simple program that graphs the pattern of the first 5000 integer using `matplotlib`. However, this number can easily be changed.
